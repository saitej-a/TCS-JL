"""Phase 6.2 boundary tests (replacing 6.1's retired scope test).

Proves the deliberate scope boundaries of Phase 6.2 (D15, D16, R1):
1. No Announcement model or import inside apps.notifications (D15).
2. broadcast_announcement is not implemented; route stays inert (D15).
3. No frontend JS / service workers, and no producer functions for dormant types (D16, R1).
