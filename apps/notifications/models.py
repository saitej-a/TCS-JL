"""Notification / device models — the delivery substrate for Phase 6 (T6.1-T6.3; 6.1 D1-D6).

Domain shape (07 §3.1-§3.3, 03 §8 + §12):

* `Notification` — the authoritative, append-only log of in-app alerts. `title` and
  `message` are **stored snapshots** written at creation time (D3): deleting the
  source post or comment later must not rewrite what a user was told, so this model
  composes and renders nothing (D4). Anonymity-safe labels ("A candidate", a handle)
  are baked in by 6.2's `create_notification` service via `AuthorPublicSerializer`
  semantics, which is what makes 07 §8's zero-PII push rule achievable at write time
  instead of patched per reader.
* `Device` — FCM registration tokens, kept off the `User` model so one account can
  hold several browsers/phones (03 §8). 03 §8: "FCM tokens are sensitive
  infrastructure identifiers. Never expose them through public APIs" — this module
  therefore ships no token-rendering surface at all, and `write_only = True` on
  6.2's registration serializer is that rule's binding contract.
* `NotificationPreference` — the per-candidate push controls (07 §3.3), created
  lazily and explicitly via `get_or_create_for` (R6) — no `post_save` signal, so
  nothing has to be registered at import time and a new user really starts with no
  row.

Integrity guarantee (D5, beyond 07 §3.1's schema): `notification_read_state` — a
database-level `CheckConstraint` refusing a notification that claims to be read
without a read timestamp. It is the project's first `CheckConstraint`, so both layers
are proven separately: PostgreSQL holds the invariant no matter who writes (ORM,
`QuerySet.update`, admin, bulk ops; `clean()` does **not** run on those paths), and
`clean()` is the application mirror carrying the stable code
`read_state_inconsistent` for request-time callers. `mark_as_read()` (R4) is the
single sanctioned writer of the `is_read`/`read_at` pair. The constraint is
deliberately one-directional — `read_at` set while `is_read` is still False is legal,
because the timestamp and the flag can legitimately arrive in that order.

Deliberate, documented deviations (recorded for the verification record):

* **R1** — 07 §3.1-§3.2 declare the compound indexes with no names and add
  field-level `db_index=True` on individual columns. The compounds get repo-style
  names (4.1 / 5.1 P3); the field-level flags are kept **literally**, even though the
  single-column indexes on `recipient` and `user` are redundant with the leading
  column of the compounds. Dropping them would be silent spec drift, and at MVP scale
  the extra index costs nothing.
* **R3** — `Device.__str__` renders device type + browser, not `self.user.email` as
  07 §3.2 writes it. `__str__` reaches logs, admin lists, and error reports, and
   03 §8 already classes what sits behind a token as sensitive.
* **R9** — `last_seen_at` and `updated_at` are both `auto_now` (the spec has both).
  With `save(update_fields=[...])` an `auto_now` field is only refreshed when it is
  named in `update_fields`, so 6.2's token-refresh path must list `last_seen_at`
  explicitly when it wants the refresh timestamp moved.

Out of scope here: no serializer, view, URL, permission, task, or admin registration —
6.2 (endpoints) and 6.3 (Celery/FCM) own those.
