"""Celery wiring tests (Phase 8.2 — Task 6 step 3; the 6.2/7.2 name-mismatch lesson).

A Celery task name is a string, not an import path: `notifications.tasks.foo`
lives at `apps.notifications.tasks.foo`, and a beat/route entry naming a task
that was never implemented stays silently inert until it fires in production.
Phase 8.2's verification found exactly that class of defect (the reserved
announcement expiry entry pointed at a module that did not exist), so every
entry is resolved here against its real implementation.
