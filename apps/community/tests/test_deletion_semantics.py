"""Soft deletion + tombstones — COMM-05 (5.1 D3/D4; 03 §20, 08 §390-§415).

Two properties carry the requirement:

* **Nothing is physically removed.** The original text stays in the row for audit
  and legal review (08 §390), asserted here by reading the *raw* fields rather than
  through the display helpers — otherwise a masking bug could hide a deletion bug.
* **Nothing is attributed to the wrong actor.** One neutral copy serves an author's
  own deletion and a moderator's removal alike, because the single `is_deleted`
  flag cannot tell them apart (D3) — so no assertion should ever find the word
  "moderator" in the tombstone.
