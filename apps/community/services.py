"""Community services — the single write path for posts and comments (5.1 R1, R4).

`Model.clean()` is not called by `save()`, so a validator alone would leave the
reply-depth rule unenforced. These functions are where it actually runs: 5.2's
serializers delegate here (the 3.1/3.2 split — service owns the invariant,
serializer owns shape), and the model's `clean()` mirrors the same validators for
admin/forms.

Deliberately **not** here: rate limiting (5.2/T5.7), locked-post rejection and
commenter permissions (04 §42's *request-context* rules — 5.2/T5.10), and any
hard-delete path (5.1 D3/D4: removal is a flag, never a deletion).
