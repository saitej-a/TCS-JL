"""Community API serializers (T5.4-T5.11; 5.2 D1-D4, D5, P6, P9; 04 §31-§42).

Author identity is the security-sensitive surface here. Every author payload
comes from one place — `CommunityAuthorSerializer`, wrapping 3.2's
`AuthorPublicSerializer` redaction boundary plus the D2 `avatar_seed` — so no
endpoint can accidentally render an email, a real name, or a derivable colour.

D3 (recorded deviation from 08 §406): tombstoned content **keeps** its author
handle. The handle is anonymity-safe through `AuthorPublicSerializer`, so
removal hides the words, not the participation — verification reports this as
known, not as a bug.

Read shapes render through `tombstones.display_*` (5.1 R2) so the tombstone has
exactly one copy source. Write serializers own *shape* only; the invariants
belong to the 5.1 services, which the views call (the 3.1/3.2 split).
