/**
 * Backend vocabulary unions (Task 2's types file, consumed by Task 1's maps).
 *
 * These are typed to the SHIPPED backend contracts, not to the spec tables:
 * - `PostCategory` moved to `@/content/postCategories` in 9.3 (D7: the 12 keys
 *   live in exactly ONE module — this file re-exports for the established
 *   imports; the settings-added-category compile error now fires at that one
 *   module and propagates everywhere).
 * - `CandidateStatus` mirrors `apps/candidates/models.py` Status (11 choices).
 *
 * Recorded divergence (Task 1/9.1 finding): 05 §4.1.4's badge matrix lists 10
 * rows — its `OFFER` is the API's `OFFER_LETTER`, and `LOCATION`/`DOCUMENTS`
 * have no spec row (they use the GENERAL slate treatment as the fallback).
