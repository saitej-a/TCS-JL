# Roadmap: TCS Joining Tracker

## Overview

TCS Joining Tracker is delivered in 10 sequential, test-driven phases that establish the containerized infrastructure, custom user authentication system, candidate profiles, recruitment timeline engine, community discussion forums, asynchronous FCM notifications, aggregate privacy-preserving analytics, administrative moderation workflows, responsive React single-page frontend, and end-to-end launch verification.

Each phase is decomposed into decimal **sub-phases** (e.g. 1.1, 1.2 — see Phase Details) with scaffolded directories under `.planning/phases/`. Sub-phases are the discuss/plan/execute unit: plan them with `/gsd:plan-phase <N.M>`; parent phases remain the requirement-mapping and verification boundary.

## Phases

- [ ] **Phase 1: Project Foundation, Docker & Environment Setup** - Containerized stack (Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, Nginx), Git repo, and CI gates.
- [ ] **Phase 2: Authentication, Identity & Custom User System** - Custom User model (UUIDv4, case-insensitive email), Argon2id hashing, SimpleJWT rotation, email verification, and password reset.
- [ ] **Phase 3: Candidate Profiles & Public Identity Controls** - 1:1 CandidateProfile model, status choice state machine, ANONYMOUS vs DISPLAY_NAME modes, and serializer boundaries.
- [ ] **Phase 4: Recruitment Timeline Engine** - TimelineEvent model, atomic status synchronization service, IDOR protection, and candidate dashboard endpoint.
- [x] **Phase 5: Community Discussions & Forum System** - Categorized posts, 1-level nested replies, unique upvoting constraint, soft-deletion handling, and N+1 query elimination.
- [ ] **Phase 6: In-App Notifications & FCM Web Push System** - Notification model, multi-device registration, Celery push tasks with exponential backoff, and background service worker.
- [ ] **Phase 7: Community Analytics & Privacy Engine** - Cohort aggregation engine, wait-time benchmarks, mandatory `<5` candidate privacy suppression, and Redis caching.
- [ ] **Phase 8: Moderation, Anti-Spam & Administration** - XOR report model, automated scam regex heuristics, Django Admin triage tools, and session-severing user ban workflows.
- [ ] **Phase 9: Frontend Single Page Application (React + Tailwind)** - 12 responsive views, centralized Axios client with silent 401 refresh, optimistic upvoting, and PWA integration.
- [ ] **Phase 10: Security Audits, E2E Testing, Seed Data & Launch Readiness** - Realistic synthetic seed data, Bandit/Pip-audit scans, penetration tests, Nginx hardening, and load testing.

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Project Foundation, Docker & Environment Setup

**Goal**: Establish a unified, containerized local and production development environment with database extensions, health probes, and CI linting.  
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)  
**Requirements**: Foundational infrastructure  
**Success Criteria**:

  1. `docker compose up` boots Django, PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7, Celery Worker, Celery Beat, and Nginx cleanly without container exits.
  2. Database migrations enable `uuid-ossp` and `citext` extensions.
  3. Liveness probe (`/health/`) and readiness probe (`/health/ready/`) return HTTP 200 with live DB/Redis connectivity.
  4. CI pipeline passes Black, Flake8, and pytest test runs.

**Plans**: 3 plans  
Plans:

- [ ] 01-01: Git repository initialization, branch rules, and Docker Compose topology (web, db, redis, celery, nginx).
- [ ] 01-02: Django 5.x project initialization with modular split settings and PostgreSQL/Redis connection pooling.
- [ ] 01-03: Health readiness endpoints (`/health/`, `/health/ready/`) and GitHub Actions CI workflow.

**Sub-phases** (planning & execution units; dirs under `.planning/phases/`):

#### Phase 1.1: Containerization & Compose Topology

**Goal**: Git repo/branch rules plus the full Docker Compose topology (web, db, redis, celery, nginx).
**Plans**: 01-01
**Done when**: `docker compose up` builds and boots all services without container exits.

#### Phase 1.2: Django Settings, Health Probes & CI

**Goal**: Django 5.x init with modular split settings, DB/Redis connection pooling, health probes, and CI gates.
**Plans**: 01-02, 01-03
**Done when**: Probes return HTTP 200 with live DB/Redis; CI passes Black, Flake8, and pytest.

### Phase 2: Authentication, Identity & Custom User System

**Goal**: Implement secure candidate registration, password hashing, email verification, password reset, and JWT session handling.  
**Depends on**: Phase 1  
**Requirements**: AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03, AUTH-04, AUTH-05, AUTH-06  
**Success Criteria**:

  1. User can register with case-insensitive email and receive a 24-hour verification token.
  2. Passwords hashed using Argon2id with 64MB memory cost and PBKDF2 fallback.
  3. SimpleJWT issues 15-minute access tokens and 7-day rotating refresh tokens; replaying rotated tokens revokes the session family.
  4. Account deletion completely anonymizes candidate records while preserving discussion integrity.

**Plans**: 3 plans  
Plans:

- [ ] 02-01: Custom `accounts.User` model with UUIDv4 PK, `CITEXT` email, and Argon2id password hasher configuration.
- [ ] 02-02: Registration, email verification, password reset, and rate-limited login endpoints with anti-enumeration responses.
- [ ] 02-03: SimpleJWT token rotation/blacklisting configuration, current user (`/me/`) endpoint, and account deletion service.

**Sub-phases** (planning & execution units; dirs under `.planning/phases/`):

#### Phase 2.1: Custom User Model & Password Hashing

**Goal**: `accounts.User` with UUIDv4 PK, case-insensitive CITEXT email, and Argon2id hashing (AUTH-01).
**Plans**: 02-01
**Done when**: Custom user model migrates cleanly; Argon2id hashes on the registration path.

#### Phase 2.2: Registration, JWT & Account Lifecycle

**Goal**: Registration, email verification, password reset, rate-limited anti-enumeration login, SimpleJWT rotation/blacklisting, `/me/`, and anonymizing account deletion (AUTH-02..06).
**Plans**: 02-02, 02-03
**Done when**: Replaying rotated tokens revokes the session family; deletion anonymizes contributions.

### Phase 3: Candidate Profiles & Public Identity Controls

**Goal**: Build candidate recruitment profiles with strict privacy segregation between private auth credentials and public handles.  
**Depends on**: Phase 2  
**Requirements**: PROF-01, PROF-02, PROF-03, PROF-04  
**Success Criteria**:

  1. Candidate can create and edit their profile with batch, stream, region, and interview center.
  2. Public identity mode properly toggles between ANONYMOUS (default) and custom DISPLAY_NAME.
  3. Controlled status choices enforced from REGISTERED to JOINED.
  4. Public serializers strictly omit email, phone, and internal IDs.

**Plans**: 2 plans  
Plans:

- [x] 03-01: `CandidateProfile` model (1:1 with User), status choices, and public identity toggle logic. *(executed 2026-09-21)*
- [x] 03-02: Profile CRUD endpoints (`/api/v1/profile/`), serializer boundary segregation, and display name impersonation blocking. *(executed 2026-09-21)*

**Sub-phases** (planning & execution units; dirs under `.planning/phases/`):

#### Phase 3.1: Candidate Profile Model & Status Machine

**Goal**: 1:1 `CandidateProfile` with batch/stream/region/center fields, REGISTERED→JOINED status choices, and identity-mode toggle (PROF-01..03).
**Plans**: 03-01
**Done when**: Profile model and status state machine enforce valid transitions.

#### Phase 3.2: Profile API & Privacy Boundaries

**Goal**: `/api/v1/profile/` CRUD with serializer segregation excluding email/phone/internal IDs, and display-name impersonation blocking (PROF-04).
**Plans**: 03-02
**Done when**: Public serializers leak no PII; impersonation attempts are rejected.

### Phase 4: Recruitment Timeline Engine

**Goal**: Implement the personal recruitment timeline, milestone event tracking, and atomic status synchronization.  
**Depends on**: Phase 3  
**Requirements**: TIME-01, TIME-02, TIME-03, TIME-04, TIME-05  
**Success Criteria**:

  1. Candidate can record milestones (Interview, Selection, Offer, Survey, JL, Date, Joined) with date and notes.
  2. Recording a JL event atomically updates the candidate's profile status in the same database transaction.
  3. Timeline queries strictly scope to `request.user` and return HTTP 404 on unauthorized access attempts.
  4. Authenticated dashboard endpoint aggregates status progression, latest milestone, and community comparison benchmarks.

**Plans**: 2 plans  
Plans:

- [x] 04-01: `TimelineEvent` model, chronological compound indexes, and atomic status synchronization service. *(executed 2026-09-21)*
- [x] 04-02: Timeline CRUD endpoints (`/api/v1/timeline/`), `IsTimelineOwner` IDOR permissions, and candidate dashboard endpoint. *(executed 2026-09-22)*

**Sub-phases** (planning & execution units; dirs under `.planning/phases/`):

#### Phase 4.1: Timeline Model & Atomic Status Sync

**Goal**: `TimelineEvent` model with chronological compound indexes and transactional status synchronization (TIME-01, TIME-02).
**Plans**: 04-01
**Done when**: Recording a milestone updates profile status in the same database transaction.

#### Phase 4.2: Timeline API, IDOR Defense & Dashboard

**Goal**: Timeline CRUD scoped to owner with HTTP 404 IDOR responses, plus aggregated dashboard endpoint (TIME-03..05).
**Plans**: 04-02
**Done when**: Unauthorized timeline access returns 404; dashboard aggregates community benchmarks.

### Phase 5: Community Discussions & Forum System

**Goal**: Build categorized discussion threads, 1-level nested comments, unique post voting, and soft deletion.
**Depends on**: Phase 3  
**Requirements**: COMM-01, COMM-02, COMM-03, COMM-04, COMM-05, COMM-06, COMM-07, COMM-08  
**Success Criteria**:

  1. Candidates can browse a paginated feed filtered by category, search keywords, and sorting order.
  2. Comment replies are strictly capped at 1-level depth (`parent.parent is None`).
  3. Post upvoting enforces `UNIQUE(user, post)` constraint, preventing duplicate votes.
  4. Soft-deleted content displays clean tombstones without breaking reply hierarchies.
  5. Feed querysets use `select_related()` and `.annotate()` to eliminate N+1 queries.

**Plans**: 3 plans  
Plans:

- [x] 05-01: `Post`, `Comment`, and `PostVote` models with soft-deletion flags, reply depth validators, and unique vote constraints. *(executed 2026-09-22)*
- [x] 05-02: Feed listing, search, category filtering, post creation (rate-limited), and post detail endpoints. *(executed 2026-09-22)*
- [x] 05-03: Comment listing/creation, upvote toggle endpoints, and staff lock/pin controls. *(executed 2026-09-22)*

**Sub-phases** (planning & execution units; dirs under `.planning/phases/`):

#### Phase 5.1: Forum Models & Deletion Semantics

**Goal**: `Post`, `Comment`, and `PostVote` models with soft-deletion tombstones, 1-level reply validators, and `UNIQUE(user, post)` vote constraint (COMM-03..05).
**Plans**: 05-01
**Done when**: Duplicate votes are impossible at DB level; tombstones preserve reply trees.

#### Phase 5.2: Feed, Comments & Voting Endpoints

**Goal**: Paginated feed with category/search/sort, rate-limited post creation, comment + upvote endpoints, staff lock/pin, and N+1-free querysets (COMM-01, 02, 06..08).
**Plans**: 05-02, 05-03
**Done when**: Feed queries show no N+1; moderation controls restrict correctly.

### Phase 6: In-App Notifications & FCM Web Push System

**Goal**: Build persistent in-app notifications and real-time browser push alerts using Firebase Cloud Messaging and Celery.  
**Depends on**: Phase 5  
**Requirements**: NOTIF-01, NOTIF-02, NOTIF-03, NOTIF-04, NOTIF-05, NOTIF-06  
**Success Criteria**:

  1. In-app notifications created for comments, replies, upvote milestones, and announcements with read tracking.
  2. Multi-device FCM token registration stores tokens via write-only serializers.
  3. Celery background tasks dispatch FCM push notifications with exponential backoff and zero PII payloads.
  4. Self-action notifications are suppressed; Redis debounces thread push alerts to 1 per 15 minutes.
  5. Stale tokens are deactivated on `UnregisteredError`; inactive devices older than 30 days are pruned daily.

**Plans**: 3 plans  
Plans:

- [x] 06-01: `Notification`, `Device`, and `NotificationPreference` models with compound indexes. *(executed 2026-09-22)*
- [ ] 06-02: Device registration (write-only token), device revocation, notification list, and mark-read endpoints.
- [ ] 06-03: Firebase Admin SDK integration, Celery push multicast task, self-action suppression, and service worker push handler.

**Sub-phases** (planning & execution units; dirs under `.planning/phases/`):

#### Phase 6.1: Notification & Device Models

**Goal**: `Notification`, `Device`, and `NotificationPreference` models with compound indexes for read tracking (NOTIF-01).
**Plans**: 06-01
**Done when**: Notification models migrate with performant lookup indexes.

#### Phase 6.2: Device Registration & FCM Push

**Goal**: Write-only FCM token registration/revocation, notification list + mark-read endpoints, Celery multicast push with backoff, self-action suppression, and stale-token pruning (NOTIF-02..06).
**Plans**: 06-02, 06-03
**Done when**: Push payloads carry zero PII; Redis debounces thread alerts to 1 per 15 minutes.

### Phase 7: Community Analytics & Privacy Engine

**Goal**: Implement cohort-level recruitment analytics, wait-time calculations, and the mandatory `<5` candidate privacy suppression threshold.  
**Depends on**: Phase 4  
**Requirements**: ANAL-01, ANAL-02, ANAL-03, ANAL-04, ANAL-05  
**Success Criteria**:

  1. Aggregate metrics calculate wait times, stream breakdowns, and regional distributions from community data.
  2. Cohorts with fewer than 5 candidates trigger the mandatory privacy suppression response.
  3. All analytics responses carry the `COMMUNITY_REPORTED` attribution and non-affiliation disclaimer.
  4. Overview and batch statistics are cached in Redis with hourly Celery Beat warmup routines.

**Plans**: 2 plans  
Plans:

- [x] 07-01: Analytics aggregation service, wait-time calculation engine, and `<5` candidate privacy suppression threshold. *(executed 2026-09-22)*
- [x] 07-02: Overview, batch, stream, regional analytics endpoints, Redis caching layer, and public landing stats endpoint. *(executed 2026-09-22 — 04 §52 timeline analytics deferred by decision; see 07.2-SUMMARY.md)*

**Sub-phases** (planning & execution units; dirs under `.planning/phases/`):

#### Phase 7.1: Analytics Aggregation & Privacy Suppression

**Goal**: Cohort aggregation service, wait-time calculation engine, and mandatory `<5` candidate privacy suppression (ANAL-03, ANAL-04).
**Plans**: 07-01
**Done when**: Sub-5 cohorts return the standard privacy notice, never data.

#### Phase 7.2: Analytics Endpoints & Redis Caching

**Goal**: Overview/batch/stream/region endpoints, `COMMUNITY_REPORTED` labeling, and Redis caching with hourly Celery Beat warmup (ANAL-01, 02, 05).
**Plans**: 07-02
**Done when**: Cached responses are served with attribution labels intact.
**Executed**: 2026-09-22 (plan 07-02) — five anonymous endpoints (04 §48–§51 plus §80's `/public/stats/`), payload-level Redis caching behind the reserved hourly warmup, per-row `<5` suppression, `analytics_reads` throttling and whitelist filter validation; 638-test suite green, 19/19 live HTTP drill checks. **04 §52 `/analytics/timeline/` is a recorded gap, not built.**

### Phase 8: Moderation, Anti-Spam & Administration

**Goal**: Build candidate content reporting, automated scam heuristics, Django Admin moderation tools, and user suspension workflows.  
**Depends on**: Phase 5  
**Requirements**: MOD-01, MOD-02, MOD-03, MOD-04, MOD-05, MOD-06  
**Success Criteria**:

  1. Candidate can report posts or comments with database-level XOR constraint enforcing exactly one target.
  2. Duplicate pending reports on the same target are blocked; report creation is throttled to 10/hour.
  3. Automated regex heuristics intercept paid job scams, fee extortion, and NextStep password requests.
  4. Banning an account atomically sets `is_active=False`, blacklists refresh tokens, and halts device push alerts.
  5. Staff can triage reports and soft-delete content directly in Django Admin.

**Plans**: 3 plans  
Plans:

- [x] 08-01: `Report` model with database XOR check constraint, reporting endpoint, and pending deduplication. *Executed 2026-09-22 (plan 08.1-01)*
- [x] 08-02: Automated scam regex heuristics scanner and 60-minute duplicate post debouncing in Redis. *Executed 2026-09-22 (plan 08.1-02)*
- [x] 08-03: Django Admin `ReportAdmin` customization, announcement model/broadcast task, and user suspension protocol. *Executed 2026-09-23 (plan 08.2-01); verified 2026-09-23 (58/58 live drill, gates green)*

**Sub-phases** (planning & execution units; dirs under `.planning/phases/`):

#### Phase 8.1: Report Model & Scam Heuristics

**Goal**: `Report` model with XOR post/comment constraint, throttled deduplicated reporting, and automated scam regex scanning (MOD-01..04).
**Plans**: 08-01, 08-02
**Done when**: XOR constraint enforced at DB level; scam posts are intercepted pre-publication.
**Executed**: 2026-09-22 (plans 08.1-01 + 08.1-02) — `apps/moderation` with the XOR constraint, pending-dedup UniqueConstraints, throttled reporting endpoint, scam scanner on all four write surfaces, and the title+body debounce; 694 tests green. Done-when met.

#### Phase 8.2: Admin Triage & Ban Workflow

**Goal**: Django Admin triage with bulk actions, announcement broadcasts, and atomic ban protocol — `is_active=False`, token blacklist, push halt (MOD-05, MOD-06).
**Plans**: 08-03
**Done when**: Banned accounts lose sessions and device alerts atomically.
**Verified**: 2026-09-23 (round-2 PASS — `VERIFICATION.md`) — an independent live drill (58/58) proved the two asynchronous contracts complete through a real broker and worker: a `BAN_USER` review over HTTP blacklists refresh tokens and deactivates devices, and a published announcement fans out in-app rows. The Django Admin triage actions were driven over real staff sessions and produce identical DB effects to the REST path. Round 1's FAIL (execution at 2 of 7 tasks) is superseded; its findings F1–F5 are all closed. Observations O1–O3 are tracked in the phase's VERIFICATION.md (expiry task's queue choice; 8.1-inherited §107 naming; a pytest dispatch guard).

**Executed**: 2026-09-23 (plan 08.2-01) — five-action triage over REST (`/api/v1/moderation/reports/`, `.../review/`, `/users/{id}/ban|unban/`) and Django Admin (`ReportAdmin` bulk actions + staff-safe `UserAdmin` ban/unban), the ban protocol of 08 §6 (transaction commits `is_active=False`/`banned_until` + the §11.1 audit line; an **idempotent** Celery task then blacklists refresh tokens and deactivates devices — the spec's own two-step shape, atomic at the user-facing transaction), temporary 7-day suspensions with an hourly auto-reinstate beat entry, 403 `ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED` login, and the announcement system deferred here by 6.2 D15 (model, staff CRUD + public read, chunked FCM broadcast at the byte-exact reserved route name, hourly expiry task). Two migrations (`0005_user_banned_until`, `community 0002_announcement`); 94 new tests, **788 green**, lint/format/drift clean.
**Verification**: **complete (PASS)** — `VERIFICATION.md` holds the round-2 verdict. The round-1 FAIL record (interrupted execution at 2 of 7 tasks) is superseded, and its F1–F5 findings are all closed and re-checked (F1 beat entry added and observed reinstating a lapsed ban; F2 announcements implemented and observed broadcasting; F3 Admin shipped and driven over HTTP; F4 §107 names present + the wiring test resolves every beat/route entry; F5 commit→dispatch proven end-to-end by the live drill).

### Phase 9: Frontend Single Page Application (React + Tailwind)

**Goal**: Construct the 12 core responsive views, centralized Axios client, optimistic UI mutators, and PWA integration.  
**Depends on**: Phase 8  
**Requirements**: UI-01, UI-02, UI-03, UI-04, UI-05  
**Success Criteria**:

  1. 12 responsive views render cleanly across desktop (3-col), tablet (2-col), and mobile (5-slot bottom tab bar with 44px touch targets).
  2. Centralized Axios client automatically performs silent JWT refresh on HTTP 401 and replays requests.
  3. Upvote pill component updates optimistically with automatic rollback on network failure.
  4. Mandatory TCS non-affiliation disclaimer appears across all public headers, footers, and analytics views.
  5. Service worker displays background push notifications and deep-links on click.

**Plans**: 4 plans  
Plans:

- [x] 09-01: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind setup, design system tokens, and centralized Axios client with 401 interceptors. *(Executed 2026-09-23: `frontend/` workspace with the D3 dev proxy + byte-exact 05 §4 token layer, single-flight 401 client (D2), bootable router with guards + stub pages (D9), T9.3 component library + Disclaimer/EmptyState/IdentityPill (D10); 76 frontend tests green, backend unchanged at 788, done-when observed live in a browser: 401 → one refresh POST → replayed 200.)*
- [x] 09-02: Responsive layout shells, landing screen with live stats, authentication views, and 3-step onboarding wizard. (Executed 2026-09-23: AppShell 3-col/tablet/mobile + §5.5 banner, §7.1 landing with real 3-counter stats, six §7.2 auth screens with error mapping, §7.3 wizard gated on the now-truthful profile_completed flag — step 2 writes a timeline event (walk-the-chain) instead of the single-hop PATCH; 98 frontend tests, backend 790; live journey + both breakpoints proven in-browser.)
- [x] 09-03: Candidate dashboard with stepper bar, interactive timeline roadmap, and community feed with category tabs. *(Executed 2026-09-24: §7.4 dashboard (stepper over the real timeline rows, suppression-aware benchmark, status-count pulse, newest-discussions block), §7.5 interactive roadmap with add/edit/delete + quick actions, §7.6 feed (URL-stateful pills/tabs/debounced search, pinned card, optimistic upvote pill, pagination) and §7.7 create post; four backend repairs rode along — anonymous community reads (200 read / 401 write, observed), the deleted-post feed filter with its vacuous test repaired, `has_voted` on the vote response, and write throttles that actually engage. Gates: frontend 130 tests / lint / typecheck / build, backend 804, settings clean. Both halves of the done-when observed live in a browser — upvote `Upvoted | 2` during flight → `Upvote | 1` + error toast after a transport failure → `Upvoted | 2` with the server reporting `vote_count: 2`; and filtering/search/pagination all issuing the expected requests. Design: the 7 Stitch mockups were re-read and reconciled (22 aligned, 14 divergences recorded, 3 real defects fixed) in `09.3-DESIGN-RECONCILIATION.md`.)*
- [ ] 09-04: Post detail with 1-level comments, analytics dashboard with privacy callouts, notification center, and PWA service worker.

**Sub-phases** (planning & execution units; dirs under `.planning/phases/`):

### Phase 09.5: UI/UX design pass: ui-ux-pro-max + Stitch screens (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Design and implement the surfaces 9.2–9.4 left undesigned — the settings suite (currently one-line stubs), the admin console (no frontend at all, though 8.2's APIs exist), and the 404/render-error/empty states — through the `ui-ux-pro-max` design pass and Google Stitch screen mockups, landing a reconciled professional-blue token layer (§4 v2) underneath.
**Requirements**: SET-01, UI-06, UI-07, MOD-07 (extends UI-04, UI-05)
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 09.5-01 — Design token v2 + 05 §4 reconciliation, settings suite (hub/profile/privacy/security/devices/danger), admin console (reports + announcements), 404/error states, v2 re-check of the shipped screens. Design work done: Stitch design system `assets/9909951007419684952` + 8 screens (catalogue in `09.5-CONTEXT.md` §5). *Nothing implemented yet — the code work is the plan's remaining tasks.*

### Phase 09.5.1: Generate the missing Stitch screens with ui-ux-pro-max design intelligence (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Close the design pass's last gap and pay off what reading it exposed — the five Stitch screens generated for 9.2/9.5's undesigned auth/security/legal surfaces are read as markup (not trusted from the generator's summary), the four auth/security screens are reconciled against the shipped pages, and the three informational/legal routes stop being `StubPage` skeletons and become real pages on a §5.4 visitor shell telling the truth about the shipped API.
**Requirements**: UI-01..UI-07 close in 9.5; this phase's contract is `09.5.1-CONTEXT.md` D-01..D-16 + `09.5.1-UI-SPEC.md` (no new REQUIREMENTS ids)
**Depends on**: Phase 9.5
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:

- [ ] 09.5.1-01 — **HALTED 2026-09-29 at the D-15/D-16 copy gate (a designed stop, not a failure).** Shipped and committed: the cross-stack `passwordRules` module + backend parity guard (kills the shipped "8 characters" bug both password forms carried), the in-card resend field replacing `window.prompt`, honest 60-minute reset copy with wrapping-safe tokens, the shared auth-aware §5.4 visitor shell, and `LegalLayout` + the three content modules with the last three stubs replaced. Outstanding: the **user's own copy** for `/about`, `/privacy`, `/terms` — the modules hold the paste map and `copy.test.ts` the banned-fiction ledger; the awaiting-copy state renders title + honesty line rather than placeholder prose. Gates at the halt: frontend 264 tests / lint 0 errors / build clean, backend 855, contrast clean apart from 9.5's two deliberate demo rows. Resume steps in `09.5.1-01-SUMMARY.md`; halt handoff in the phase dir's `.continue-here.md`.

### Phase 10: Security Audits, E2E Testing, Seed Data & Launch Readiness

**Goal**: Perform comprehensive security audits, load testing, seed data provisioning, Nginx hardening, and final production sign-off.  
**Depends on**: Phase 9  
**Requirements**: Full system verification  
**Success Criteria**:

  1. Synthetic seed data generator populates 50 realistic candidates, 220+ timeline events, 25 posts, and 8 moderation cases.
  2. Bandit AST scans and Pip-Audit vulnerability checks report zero high/medium security issues.
  3. Automated penetration tests confirm IDOR protection on timeline events and zero duplicate voting leaks.
  4. Nginx security headers (HSTS 1 year, CSP, X-Frame-Options DENY) validated.
  5. 50-concurrent-user load tests confirm sub-200ms p95 API response times.

**Plans**: 2 plans  
Plans:

- [ ] 10-01: Synthetic seed data management command (`seed_community_data.py`) and Playwright/Cypress end-to-end user journey tests.
- [ ] 10-02: Security audits (Bandit, Pip-Audit, IDOR penetration), Nginx TLS hardening, load testing, and production launch sign-off.

**Sub-phases** (planning & execution units; dirs under `.planning/phases/`):

#### Phase 10.1: Seed Data & E2E Journeys

**Goal**: Synthetic seed data (50 candidates, 220+ timeline events, 25 posts, 8 moderation cases) and Playwright/Cypress end-to-end user journeys.
**Plans**: 10-01
**Done when**: Seeds reproduce realistic community distributions; E2E journeys pass.

#### Phase 10.2: Security Audits, Hardening & Signoff

**Goal**: Bandit/Pip-Audit scans, IDOR penetration tests, Nginx TLS/header hardening, 50-concurrent-user load test, and production launch sign-off.
**Plans**: 10-02
**Done when**: Zero high/medium findings; sub-200ms p95 under load.

### Phase 11: Unlimited nested comment replies

**Goal**: A comment can be replied to at any depth — a reply may itself receive replies, with no application-level depth cap. **This supersedes a shipped, spec'd rule and is the phase's first decision, not a silent edit:** 05 §1183 mandates *"Strict 1-Level Nesting … (`parent.parent == NULL` enforced by backend and UI)"*, 05 §75 justifies it ("no complex nested comment trees"), and PROJECT.md carries it as both requirement **COMM-03** and a key decision (*"Strict 1-Level Reply Depth … ✓ Good"*). The shipped code implements that rule three ways: `validate_reply_depth` (`apps/community/validators.py`, code `nested_reply`), the `Comment.parent = SET_NULL` promotion rule (a deleted parent **promotes** its reply to top level — 5.1 P4), and the UI's single indent unit with no Reply affordance past depth 1 (`CommentThread.tsx`). Recording the supersession deliberately (COMM-03 in REQUIREMENTS.md, the two 05 sections, the PROJECT.md decision row) is part of the work.
**Requirements**: supersedes COMM-03; 04's comment contracts and 05 §7.7's thread UI to be re-derived
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:

- [ ] TBD (run /gsd-plan-phase 11 to break down)

**Known surface at add time** (for the planner, from a quick scan — not a design):

- **Write path**: `validate_reply_depth` (`nested_reply`), `parent_post_mismatch`, `parent_deleted` — the depth rule is the one that changes; the other two are cross-post/parent-integrity checks that stay.
- **`Comment.parent` is `SET_NULL`**: today a deleted parent promotes its reply instead of destroying it (5.1 P4). At unlimited depth, "promote vs keep the branch anchored vs tombstone-in-place" is a real decision, and the reply's indent unit no longer identifies its level.
- **Read path**: the thread is assembled top-level + one `replies` level. Depth-N assembly is a new query shape (recursive CTE vs `prefetch_related` walk) with N+1 and pagination consequences — `MAX_DEPTH` is **not** in the current model.
- **UI**: indentation stops being a level marker; 05's mobile rationale for the cap (runaway indentation) has to be answered by the actual design (depth rails, "replying to @author" context, collapse, or a focus-in thread) — `CommentThread.tsx` today renders exactly one `border-l-2 pl-4` unit and a Reply button only on top-level rows.
- **Tests that pin the old rule by name**: `apps/community/tests/test_reply_depth.py` and `test_comment_api.py`'s `nested_reply` case — these must be rewritten deliberately with the supersession documented, never silently greened.
