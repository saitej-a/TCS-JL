# TCS Joining Tracker — Product Requirements Document

**Document:** 01_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md  
**Product:** TCS Joining Tracker  
**Version:** 1.0 — MVP  
**Status:** Development Specification  

---

# 1. Product Overview

## 1.1 Product Name

**TCS Joining Tracker**

A community-driven web application for candidates who are waiting for their TCS joining letter, joining date, onboarding communication, or related updates.

## 1.2 Product Purpose

The application helps TCS candidates:

- Track their own recruitment and joining timeline.
- See how other candidates are progressing.
- Share joining-related updates.
- Discuss offer letters, joining letters, locations, onboarding, and related topics.
- Understand community-reported trends without relying on scattered WhatsApp, Telegram, Reddit, or social-media discussions.
- Receive notifications when relevant community activity occurs.

The product is **not an official TCS platform** and must clearly communicate that it is an independent community platform.

---

# 2. Problem Statement

Candidates who have completed TCS recruitment processes often have difficulty understanding what is happening after selection or offer issuance.

Information is commonly distributed across:

- WhatsApp groups
- Telegram groups
- Reddit
- LinkedIn
- YouTube comments
- Personal contacts
- Different candidate groups

This information is fragmented, difficult to search, and often lacks structured timelines.

Candidates need a centralized place where they can:

1. Record their recruitment timeline.
2. Compare their progress with voluntarily submitted community data.
3. Discuss updates.
4. Discover whether other candidates with similar profiles have received joining-related communication.
5. Receive important community updates.

---

# 3. Product Vision

Build a trusted community-powered platform where a TCS candidate can answer:

> "Where am I in the joining process, and what are other candidates experiencing?"

The platform should combine:

- Personal Timeline
- Community Discussions
- Anonymous Aggregated Data
- Notifications

---

# 4. MVP Goals

The MVP must provide:

## 4.1 Candidate Accounts

Users can:

- Register.
- Log in.
- Log out.

---

# 6. Privacy and Identity

Privacy is a core product requirement.

Users must not be required to expose their real identity publicly.

Public identity modes:

### Anonymous

```text
Anonymous Candidate
2025 • Digital
Hyderabad
```

Categories should be extensible.

---

# 8. Community Posts

A post contains:

- Title
- Body
- Category
- Created date
- Updated date
- Vote count
- Comment count
- Moderation status

Example:

```text
Anyone from 2025 Digital Hyderabad
received their JL?

Has anyone from Hyderabad who completed
the readiness survey received their joining
letter?

↑ 42       💬 18
```

---

# 9. Comments

Users can comment on posts and reply to comments.

Users can:

- Create comments.
- Reply to comments.
- Delete their own comments where permitted.
- Report inappropriate comments.

---

# 10. Voting

Users can vote on community posts.

The MVP supports:

- Upvote
- Remove vote

A user must not be able to create multiple votes for the same post.

The database must enforce this with an appropriate uniqueness constraint.

---

# 11. Community Timeline Analytics

The application aggregates voluntarily submitted candidate data.

Example:

```text
2025 Batch

Candidates tracked: 1,248

Interview completed       1,248
Offer Letter received    1,180
Readiness survey           940
Joining Letter             210
Joining Date                87
Joined                      42
```

These figures must be clearly identified as:

> **Community-reported data**

They must never be represented as official TCS statistics.

---

# 12. Timeline Filtering

Users should eventually be able to filter community data by:

- Batch
- Hiring type
- Region
- Interview center
- Joining location
- Status
- Time period

The MVP should implement only filters that can be supported reliably by available data.

---

# 13. Community Statistics

The dashboard may display:

- Total candidates tracked
- Candidates waiting for JL
- Candidates reporting JL received
- Candidates reporting joining date
- Candidates reporting joined
- Number of timeline updates
- Number of community posts
- Number of active candidates

All statistics must include appropriate context regarding their source and limitations.

---

# 14. Dashboard

After login, the candidate should see a personal dashboard.

Example:

```text

---

# 16. Search

The MVP supports basic search across:

Advanced full-text search is not required for the first version.

---

# 17. Notifications

The MVP should support:

- Comment on your post
- Reply to your comment
- Vote on your post
- Mention where supported
- Important community announcement
- Timeline-related reminder

The system should be designed so browser push notifications can be supported.

---

# 18. Browser Push Notifications

The application may use Firebase Cloud Messaging for browser notifications.

Architecture:

```text
User
 ↓
Browser
 ↓
FCM Token
 ↓
Django
 ↓
Celery
 ↓
Firebase Cloud Messaging
 ↓
Browser Notification
```

A user may have multiple registered devices.

FCM tokens must not be stored as a single field on the main user record.

---

# 19. Announcements

Administrators can create important announcements.

Announcements can be:

- Published
- Unpublished
- Pinned
- Expired

---

# 20. Moderation

Users can report:

- OTHER

Administrators can:

- Review reports
- Delete posts

---

# 21. Anti-Spam

The MVP should include:

- Rate limiting on post creation.

- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints.
- Server-side input validation.
- Maximum content length.
- Basic abuse protection.

Advanced anti-spam systems are out of scope.

---

# 22. Admin Dashboard

Administrators need a basic dashboard.

The admin should be able to view:

- Users
- Candidates
- Posts
- Comments
- Reports
- Announcements
- Timeline statistics

Django Admin may be used initially instead of creating a custom admin interface.

---

# 23. User Status

Initial statuses:

- WAITING
- JL_RECEIVED
- JOINING_DATE_RECEIVED
- JOINED
- WITHDRAWN
- UNKNOWN

The system should allow additional statuses later.

---

# 24. Timeline Event Model

Timeline events should be represented independently from the candidate profile.

Conceptually:

```text
Candidate
    │
    ├── Timeline Event
    ├── Timeline Event
    ├── Timeline Event
    └── Timeline Event
```

Each event contains:

- Event type
- Event date
- Optional description
- Created timestamp
- Updated timestamp

---

# 25. Data Accuracy

The platform is based on voluntarily submitted community data.

Therefore:

- User-submitted information must not automatically be treated as verified.
- Community statistics must be labeled accordingly.
- The application must not claim that community data represents all TCS candidates.
- The application must not imply that TCS has endorsed or provided the platform.
- Official TCS communication should only be represented as official when it comes from an identifiable official source or is clearly labeled as such.

---

# 26. Important Disclaimer

The website should contain:

> **TCS Joining Tracker is an independent community platform and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or operated by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Information displayed on the platform is primarily user-submitted and may not represent official TCS information.**

This disclaimer should appear on:

- Footer
- About page
- Registration/onboarding flow where appropriate

---

# 27. Security Requirements

Required:

- Password hashing using Django's authentication system.
- CSRF protection.
- Authentication and authorization.
- Server-side validation.
- Secure cookies.
- Environment variables for secrets.

Sensitive user information must not be exposed through public APIs.

---

# 28. File Uploads

If posts support attachments, the MVP may allow limited:

- Images
- PDF documents

Restrictions:

- Maximum file size.
- Allowed MIME types.
- Allowed extensions.
- Server-side validation.
- Secure storage.

Executable files must never be accepted.

---

# 29. Mobile Responsiveness

The website must be fully responsive across:

- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

The mobile experience is particularly important.

---

# 30. PWA

The application should be designed so it can eventually function as a Progressive Web App.

MVP PWA capabilities may include:

- Installable website
- App icon
- Responsive UI
- Service worker
- Browser notifications

Offline-first functionality is not required.

---

# 31. Performance Requirements

Initial target:

```text
~2,000 registered users
~500 daily active users
~20 concurrent users
```

The architecture should scale beyond these numbers without requiring a complete rewrite.

Requirements:

- Pagination for posts and comments.
- Database indexes for frequently queried fields.
- Efficient ORM queries.
- Avoid N+1 queries.
- Caching where useful.
- Background processing for notifications and expensive tasks.

---

# 32. Recommended MVP Architecture

The application should initially be a modular Django monolith.

Suggested structure:

tcs_joining_tracker/

    config/

    accounts/
    candidates/
    timeline/
    community/
    notifications/
    moderation/
    analytics/

    manage.py
```

Backend:

- Python
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Celery

Frontend may use:

- React + Tailwind CSS

or a Django-based frontend if faster development is preferred.

The architecture should avoid unnecessary microservices.

---

# 33. Core Data Entities

The MVP should contain approximately:

```text
User
CandidateProfile
TimelineEvent
Device

Post
Comment
PostVote

Notification
Report
Announcement
```

# 41. Product Principles

### Community first

The application exists to help candidates share useful information.

### Privacy first

Users should never need to expose sensitive personal information to participate.

### Data transparency

Clearly distinguish community-reported information from official information.

### Simplicity

Do not add complex features that do not directly improve the core experience.

### Mobile first

The majority of users should be able to comfortably use the application from a phone.

### Scalable foundation

The MVP should be simple but structured well enough to support future growth.

### No false certainty

Incomplete community reports must not be presented as definitive claims about TCS hiring or joining processes.

---

# 42. Future Product Direction

Possible post-MVP features:

- Private messaging (DMs)
- Real-time community chat (Phase 13 delivered single shared channel #General + category rooms; private 1:1 chat remains post-MVP)
- Advanced timeline analytics
- Regional communities
- Batch-specific communities
- Verified update system
- Official-source update aggregation
- Email notifications
- Telegram/WhatsApp integrations
- Native mobile applications
- Advanced moderation
- AI-powered search
- Community reputation system

These are outside the initial MVP scope.

---

# 43. Final MVP Definition

The MVP is a:

> **Privacy-conscious, community-driven TCS joining tracker that allows candidates to maintain their recruitment timeline, participate in discussions, and explore aggregated community-reported joining trends.**

The product should prioritize:

```text
Personal Timeline
        ↓
Community (including Phase 13 shared messaging)
        ↓
Aggregated Data
        ↓
Notifications
```

over secondary features such as private 1-on-1 messaging or native mobile apps (Phase 13 delivered the single shared channel and category rooms for community messaging).

The initial release should be a modular Django application with PostgreSQL as the primary database, Redis/Celery for background tasks, and browser/PWA support for notifications.

All user-generated statistics must be explicitly labeled as community-reported and must not be presented as official TCS information.
